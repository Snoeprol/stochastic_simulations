# Stochastic Simulations Assignment 1

This project explores different sampling methods, statistical confidence measures and multi-dimensional fitting to data using the Mandelbrot set.

## Examples and features

Example of interesting files to run:

produce_surface_plots.py
control_variets.py
readmatrix.py
T_test_F_test.py

## Requirements

This project requires matplotlib, numpy, scipy and tqdm

## Installation and Getting Started
